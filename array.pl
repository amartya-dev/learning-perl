# Reason for the above way of accessing
# The prime rule is this: the prefix represents what you want to 
# get, not what you've got.
# So @ represents a list of values, and $ represents a single 
# scalar. Hence, when we're
# getting a single scalar from an array, we never prefix 
# the variable with @ â€“ that would
# mean a list. A single scalar is always prefixed with a $.

# Assigning values is somewhat similar
$array1[-1] = "hello";
print "@array1\n";
@array1[0, 1] = ("hi", 99);
print "@array1\n";
